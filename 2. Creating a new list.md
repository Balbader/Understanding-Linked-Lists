Initializing a new Node is similar to declaring a variable

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void){

	t_list *new_node;

	new_node = NULL:
	return (0);
}
```

1. `t_list`
	This is the keyword that defines the structure to which new_node will be pointing towards. 

2. `new_node`
	The name of the Node that is being initialized.

3. `*`
	The `*` means that we are defining a variable of type pointer and that it points towards a struct t_list.

By convention, in the case where the new Node is not assigned a value right after its initialization, it is highly recommended to assign it a value of NULL. This will avoid it to be considered as containing an element.

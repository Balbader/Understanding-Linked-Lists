A Node is a cell that is composed of 2 elements:
1. The **value** that we want to store
2. A pointer to the **address** of the following *cell* if there is one or to  **NULL** , which will define the end of the list

```c
typedef struct s_list t_list;

sturct s_list {
	void *content;
	struct s_list *next;
}
```

`typedef struct s_list t_list`
This line of code simply allow us to rename the struct. In this case the struct s_list will be renamed t_list.

`t_list` is now the keyword that will be used to declaring a new Node variable.

`void *`
Means that the Node content can point to and therefor store any variable type including struct, arrays or linked lists.

`content`
The data contained within the Node.

`*next`
Points to the address of the next Node if there is one
or
Points to NULL.
`NOTE: NULL defines the current Node as the last Node of the list.`
